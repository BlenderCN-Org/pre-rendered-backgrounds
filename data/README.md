# Game Data

To run the game, you will need to acquire the data. You can download this from the [releases](https://github.com/justinmeiners/pre-rendered-backgrounds/releases) page.

The data folder is not included in this repository because it is too large and is available under a separate license. If you are interested in an alternative license or the original source data, such as PSDs and Blender files, contact [me](https://justinmeiners.github.io).
